# uC/Shell

μC/Shell is a stand-alone module allowing a string containing a command and its argument to be parsed and executed. μC/Shell can be used with μC/OS-II, μC/OS-III, μC/TELNETs, μC/FTPs, μC/TFTPs, μC/FS, and more. μC/Shell provides a shell interface for Micrium components, but can be used within many applications as it allows for the additional of any number of commands. Modules in need of a shell facility (such as μC/TELNETs) interact with it by means of an application callback function.
